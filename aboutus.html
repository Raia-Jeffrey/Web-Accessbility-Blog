			<p>This is a personal website/blog about all things coffee and espresso<br></p>

			<p><br>I created this blog as a way of showing my knowledge and love of coffee. <br>
				after many years of barista'ing and consuming caffinated beverages.<br></p>
				
				<p><br>I first started making coffee drinks when I joined
				my highschools IT department.<br> they were housed inside the library
				which had a break room us students could use.<br> My fellow IT students and I
				naturally chose to hang out there. <br> There was both a coffee and espresso
				machine and the rest is history.<br></p>
